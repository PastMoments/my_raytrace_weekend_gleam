# Gleam implementation of Ray Tracing in One Weekend

A [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) implementation of [Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, Steve Hollasch](https://raytracing.github.io/). (Version 4.0.0-alpha.1)

Here is my final render of the first book (as on the cover). Note that it currently takes 24 hours to render this fully.

Here is an interesting (incorrect) version of the final render, due to a mistake in the defocus blur
